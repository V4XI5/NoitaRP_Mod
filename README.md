# **NoitaRP_Mod**
## Realistic Particles Mod for Noita.




### **ModInfo**
This mod changes a lot of stuff:
* life_time changes on almost every weapon based cards.
* how particles behave when next/close to an explosions.
* shockwaves from bombs will crumble the world and leave behind more particles on the ground.
* jetpack has new particle effect.
* some small game changing reworks.
* Replaces fake particles, with real interactive particles with longer life_time.
* weapons based cards now have different arguments attached to their particle emitter, like:
Wind effects, spiral forces, and interaction. making it even more immersive and fun to look at.

### **Note**
This mod does not act as way of cheating, or making things easier.
Explosions are bigger and more powerful, which can either work against you... or for you, if your smart enough.
Barrels leave behind more oil and acid, have a bigger inpact unpon explosion.
Again, this can either work for you or against you. depending on your type of gameplay.
Weapon cards are only visual changes!
